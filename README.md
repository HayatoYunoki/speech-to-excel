Whenever the availability of speech recognition services changes, the [SFSpeechRecognizer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/speech/sfspeechrecognizer) object notifies its delegate. SpokenWord provides a delegate object and implements the [speechRecognizer(_:availabilityDidChange:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/speech/sfspeechrecognizerdelegate/1649879-speechrecognizer) method to respond to availability changes. When services become unavailable, the method disables the Start Recording button and updates its title. When services become available, the method reenables the button and restores its original title.  f
